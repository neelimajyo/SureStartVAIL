### February 8th:
I am looking forward to learning how to more effiently utilize different libraries on Python for data analysis and Machine Learning. Using the libraries, I am excited for whatever creative process me and my team decide to pursue during the Makeathon, giving us real hands on experience with Artificial Intelligence.

### February 9th: 
1. Supervised and unsupervised learning are both used in analying and predicting data. Supervised learning is when a program is given data which it uses to refine its algorithm, and is then able to reach accurate conclusions when given new data. Unsupervised learning is much more abstract- where the program is simply given data and is required to determine relationships and trends on its own.
2. Scikit Learn focuses more on data modeling (targeted towards machine learning), rather than data visualization. More specificss of the skills in this library include, regression, clustering, decision trees, neural networks, and more. This is often why Pandas, Graphviz, and other data visualization libraries are used in tandem with Scikit Learn.

### February 10th:
1. Tensors are arrays of numbers that can be characterized by magnitude and multiple directions. It is used in Machine Learning for its ability to hold multi-dimensional data. Since all the data fed into a program must be numerical, it is best to utilize tensors to do so.
2. Based on the tutorial, I see that TensorFlow was used to break down the images and classify them based on their qualities. Additionally, it is used to connect different layers of images together, and other data analysis such as defining: loss functions, accuracy metric, and optimizers.
